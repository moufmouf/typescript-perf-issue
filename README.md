This is a sample project to reproduce a performance regression issue in Typescript between v5.0 and v5.1.

The project contains one big file (it was automatically generated by the ts-proto library from a protobuf file).

It is [22k lines long](src/messages.ts).

The issue is that the compilation time of this file has increased significantly between v5.0 and v5.1.

Compilation time in v5.0: 6s.
Compilation time in v5.1: 110s.

I generated trace files but I don't know how to interpret them.

Tracefile for 5.0: [traceDir_5.0.log](traceDir_5.0.log)
Tracefile for 5.1: [traceDir_5.1.log](traceDir_5.1.log)

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run typecheck -- --generateTrace traceDir_5.1`
4. Run `npx analyze-trace --color=false traceDir_5.1 > traceDir_5.1.log`
5. Downgrade to Typescript v5.0.4: `npm install typescript@5.0.4`
6. Run `npm run typecheck -- --generateTrace traceDir_5.0`
7. Run `npx analyze-trace --color=false traceDir_5.0 > traceDir_5.0.log`

Compare the 2 files `traceDir_5.1.log` and `traceDir_5.0.log` to see the difference in the compilation time.
